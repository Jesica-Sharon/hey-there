Abstract- The farming of agriculture has started past 12000 years back, Neolithic age gave birth of civilization, Farming and later being continued as traditional farming practices. India being an agrarian's country, Mostly Indian farming are dependent on rains, soil, dampness and environment challenges .Our farmers upgraded to modern state of art technology in cultivation. Globally the IoT systems has contributed its application in many fields and proven to be successful. It is the time that Indian farmer need to introduce the Smart Agricultural systems for higher crop yield. The productivity with compilation of data from sensors, actuators and modern electronic gadgets the farmer can monitor agricultural fields. In this paper, we propose  the concept of Smartfarmer-IoT Enabled Smart Farming Application which can forecast weather data, switching ON the pump motor acknowledging the dampness of soil terms of moisture levels with help of sensors which are interfaced to process module Arduino-UNO. The Smartfarmer-IoT Enabled Smart Farming Application can be operated from anywhere with help of networking technology.
